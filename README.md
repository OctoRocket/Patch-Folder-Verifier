# Patch-Folder-Verifier

Program to verify your patch names

## Explaination

I haven't coded in a while and was messing around with patch files in PaperMC and saw that the patch I had had the same number as another patch. I didn't know if this was intentional so I made this program to check for duped numbers or missing numbers.

They are formated like
0001-patch-name
0002-patch-name
...
0912-patch-name

There are test patches in test-patches
